The game would work like this: the player `@` is trapped in a box, to escape he has to realize that he is
inside the box and, for that, he has to find and tag the 4 walls that trap him/her.

Additionaly, the player can only see a certain distance (in the examples below I will draw the entire map and a <span style="color:blue"> circle </span> to represent his vision, but in the actual game everything beyong the circle would be black).

On the picture above, the player would have to tag the walls <span style="color:red">1,2,3 and 4</span>. To be able to escape.

Ok, seems pretty easy on a simple level, things can get bigger:

Now here, if the tagget wall <span style="color:red"> 5</span> he would have to try again.

As the game progresses the maps would become bigger and we could add more stuff.

Some stuff that could be added:

1. Bread crumbs to leave a mark on the floor so the player would know he/she has been there before
2. A lamp the player could leave somewhere and help light part of the map.
3. We could add enemies too, or dangerous places.

Let me know what you think on discord :D
